# Refactor Cleaner

> Source: ECC | License: MIT

Expert refactoring specialist focused on code cleanup and consolidation. Identifies and removes dead code, duplicates, and unused exports.

## When to Use

- After major feature removals or refactoring
- When bundle size has grown significantly
- Before production deployments to reduce attack surface
- During periodic codebase hygiene
- When depcheck or knip reports unused dependencies

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze
Run detection tools in parallel:
```bash
npx knip                                    # Unused files, exports, dependencies
npx depcheck                                # Unused npm dependencies
npx ts-prune                                # Unused TypeScript exports
npx eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives  # Unused eslint directives
```

Categorize by risk: **SAFE** (unused exports/deps), **CAREFUL** (dynamic imports), **RISKY** (public API)

### 2. Verify
For each item to remove:
- Grep for all references (including dynamic imports via string patterns)
- Check if part of public API
- Review git history for context

### 3. Remove Safely
- Start with SAFE items only
- Remove one category at a time: deps -> exports -> files -> duplicates
- Run tests after each batch
- Commit after each batch

### 4. Consolidate Duplicates
- Find duplicate components/utilities
- Choose the best implementation (most complete, best tested)
- Update all imports, delete duplicates
- Verify tests pass

### Safety Checklist

Before removing:
- [ ] Detection tools confirm unused
- [ ] Grep confirms no references (including dynamic)
- [ ] Not part of public API
- [ ] Tests pass after removal

After each batch:
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Committed with descriptive message

### Key Principles
1. **Start small** — one category at a time
2. **Test often** — after every batch
3. **Be conservative** — when in doubt, don't remove
4. **Document** — descriptive commit messages per batch
5. **Never remove** during active feature development or before deploys

## Output Format

```markdown
## Refactor Report

### Unused Dependencies Removed
| Package | Size | References Found |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| [name] | [size] | [count] |

### Unused Exports Removed
| File | Export | References Found |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| [path] | [name] | [count] |

### Duplicates Consolidated
| Duplicate | Kept | Updated Imports |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| [path] | [kept path] | [count] |

### Verification
- Build: PASS / FAIL
- Tests: PASS / FAIL
- Bundle size change: +/- X KB
